## Antivirus ##
**False Positive Alert**  
Due to the way I am packaging the Community Support Tool some AntiVirus software will flag it as malicious even though its not.
If your antivirus flags it you will have to either disable your antivirus temporarily to use the tool or allow the ScavengersCST.exe as a exception. 
The entire source of the tool is available in this repository I encourage everyone to read through it if you have concerns. The only part of the source that is not publicly available for obvious reasons is the API Keys which are housed in seperate resource file.
As long as you download the tool directly from this github page you are fine. 
I encourage you to compare the filehashes I generate when I package the tool to verify their authenticity the hashes are located with the releases.   

In order to help you do this I have included the hash generating script I use named hashandrelease.ps1.  

**If you downloaded the tool from anywhere other than here please immediately delete it run a virus scan and contact Cpjet64#5663 via Discord.**
